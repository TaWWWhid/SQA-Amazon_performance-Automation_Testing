# Amazon Performance Testing with JMeter

This repository contains an **automation performance testing project** conducted on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) using **Apache JMeter**.  
The objective was to simulate concurrent users accessing the site and analyze performance metrics such as response time, throughput, and error percentage.
